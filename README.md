# Description
This is another portfolio that I made, but this time it is just a single-page app. The reason that it is a single page, is because it was made in React Js. This is an advanced way to code javascript. 
        
# Installation 
There are no installation requirements, as it is all run through thebrowser
        
# Usage
You can use this page to view my portfolio, all of the projects that I have made. You can download my resume and also contact me if you would like to.
